"Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine .",anger

"He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.",sadness
"Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't.",anger
What the hell is this?,surprise
Are you crazy?,anger
You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this?,anger
Business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,anger

"Yes, on this I would.",neutral

Then help me stay.,sadness
"Well, you don't think like that.",anger
I am thinking like that.,anger

"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",sadness
"Well, I can see that.",anger
You okay?,neutral
"Yeah, I'm just-- yeah",sadness
"Just kind of feel numb, you know.",sadness
You didn't even hear?,sadness
[BREATHING] Umm.,sadness
God I've told this story so many times. Umm.,sadness
I just...I just basically lost someone that was really close to me.,sadness
"And I've kind of been dealing with all of the...the stuff, you know the hospital and people work because...",sadness

It was kind of like boom... done,sadness
It's just really weird because he was really young you know and it kind of like...,sadness

"Totally, yeah.",neutral
So weird you know that like one days it's like you know sounds so stupid but like one day someone's here. And like next day you know they're not here and it just kind of makes you like think about like life and mortality and like that kind of stuff.  You just like used to take for granted--you know.,sadness
Lock,neutral
The plans you make [GARBAGE].,neutral
"Exactly, you know, and like he had so many plans and he was going to do...",sadness

"He was a really, really good guy.",sadness
Mmhmm.,neutral
A lot of people loved him.,sadness
MMhmm.,neutral
"You know, it's like affecting a lot of people it's not just me, you know?",sadness
How long did you know each other?,neutral
Umm...,sadness

That's the wind.,neutral
About what?,neutral
"Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period?",neutral
"Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting.",anger
"For God- Grow up, Augie.  The fish are not going to arrive.",anger
Because they never do.  Have they...Have they ever?,anger
Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever.,anger
"I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting.  I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is.",sadness
"For God's sake, this is not about fish.",anger
"Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go.",neutral
"You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be.",happiness
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,sadness
Sure.  All right.  Okay.,neutral
Do you want to take off your shoes?,happiness
No.,neutral
Yes it is.,neutral
"I know you are Augie, I know.",sadness
"I know you meant this to be special, I know that you wanted it to be right, but I just can't help thinking that, I can't help wishing that I was somewhere else.",sadness
"Maybe if you were with someone else, too.",sadness
I didn't say that.,sadness
I just- I know I don't make you happy.,sadness
"Don't be ridiculous.  Anything that- anything I am doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",surprise
Yeah?,surprise
Yeah.  Don't you know that?,surprise
"You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else.  Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself.",sadness
"So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person.",neutral
"We have a great view of the moon from here, though, huh?",neutral
"Hmm.  I noticed that, it's pretty. Big old white moon.",happiness
I guess we don't need glasses.,happiness

I don't care then.,happiness
With perfect poise...,happiness
Ah...,happiness
Mmm...,happiness
"Darling, don't say that.",sadness
"Oh, yes meaning just that.",happiness
Flippancy brings out the acid in their darn sweetness and light.,happiness
Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,happiness
If one of us dies...,happiness
I think you're talking nonsense.,happiness
"See, you know I don't care what you do.  You could paint yourself green and run naked to the Place Vendome.",happiness
Do you remember that row we did have in Venice?,happiness
Which particular one?,happiness
The manager came in he found us rolling about the floor.  [LAUGHTER],happiness
I will never forget the look on his face.,happiness
oh...,happiness
We were very much younger then.,happiness
Very much sillier.,happiness
"Not sorry, no.  I can't stay here.",sadness
Why not?,sadness
For one thing your mother as much as told me to go.,neutral
[BREATHING] And then you've been kind of...,sadness
What?,neutral
You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.,sadness
From her point of view why else would I come?,neutral
"Chris, what's the matter?",sadness
Do you want to go somewhere?  Let's go.,sadness
"No, what is it?  Is your mother?",sadness
"No, no, it's nothing like that.",sadness
I don't know it's--it's complicated. But it's going from me now.,sadness
You got to tell me.,sadness
I don't know.,sadness
It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things.,sadness
Wouldn't work like this.,sadness
you know over seas I was in command of the company?,sadness
"Yeah, sure.",sadness
Well I lost them.,sadness
How many?,sadness
Pretty much all.,sadness
[BREATHING]. Geez.,sadness
"Takes awhile to toss something like that off.  I mean they weren't just men, you know.",sadness
"For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.",sadness
He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had.,sadness
"They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today...",sadness
"And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know.  But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this.  This monument...",sadness
"You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know.",sadness
"I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all...",sadness
You know.  I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again...,sadness
And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.,sadness
Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator.,sadness
'Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man...,sadness
And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it.,sadness
I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too.,sadness
Do you still feel that way?,sadness
I want you to know Annie.,sadness
What would I do with a fortune?,happiness
"Uh, what?  Craig's List?  Oh the internet thing?",neutral
He's like a house manager. Yeah.  It's a good job.,neutral
You did?,neutral
You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago.  Right?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and--,neutral
It's kind of helpful when getting a job.,neutral
Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of--",neutral
"No.  But it has an outline, you know.",neutral
"I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe--",neutral
"I am riding the bus, but by choice.",neutral
Yes.  One less car at a time.,neutral

Who do you think you are?,anger
I don't think I'm anyone.,neutral
You are so high and mighty.  I just--,anger
I- I-I didn't-- okay.,neutral
Oh.  I'm saving the environment. I'm riding this car because I- I want to.,anger
"The bus, I'm riding the bus because I want to.",anger
I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice.,anger
Presents? It was a trivial little broach.,surprise
"Well, what of it?",neutral
"No, thank you.",neutral
I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses.,anger
"Oh, you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses.",neutral
"Don't be stupid, what?",anger
Are you going out somewhere dear?,neutral
Well it's a woman's duty to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you?,anger
"You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable.",anger
"You know what?  You snap, you snap, you snap you're like a little adder.",anger
Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap.,anger
They sting.,anger
"I don't care.  I don't care, do you understand?  I don't mind if they bark and they roll about like hoops.",anger
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,anger
"Yes, I did quite a lot.",anger
I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too.,anger
"Oh, mind you own business.",anger
"I suppose you two had a riotous time, huh?  No restrain at all, very enjoyable, he never had much any how.",anger
"You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk.",anger
I am not in the least bit drunk.,anger
You always had a weak head.,anger
I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A Child of two cannot get drunk on that.,anger
"On the contrary, a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",anger
"Oh very, very interesting Amanda.  How about the child of uh... four, six or maybe nine---you know, we could work up a splendid little debate about it, you know?  Intemperate tots.",anger
Shut up.,anger
Not very funny darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy?,anger
That's a very good idea I think I will.,anger
Would you uh...turn that off please? You're going to wake the people upstairs.,anger
Why?,anger
Well then you'll wake the people downstairs.,anger
They are away in Tunis.,anger
This is no time a year for Tunis.,anger

Turn it off.,anger
Stop it. No. Go away.,anger
Amanda listen. Listen.,anger
"listen Oh I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully.",anger
That's very amusing indeed.,anger
"Oh you're cruel you're...you're...I hate you, I hate you. Go away. You're conceited. You're overbearing. You're utterly impossible.",anger
"You...You're an evil minded, self-centered little wench and I never want to see you again.",anger
This is the end do you hear me?  Finally and forever.,anger
You're not going like this.,anger
"Oh yes I am...Oh yes I am. Let go of me. You let go. You...urgh...You're a cruel friend. I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again...Ha...Never, never, never, never. I hope you die in torment. You beast.",anger

Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live.,anger
He saw it.,neutral
How could he see it?  I was the first one up; he was still in bed.,surprise
He was out here when it broke.,neutral
"He's dreaming of him again, walking around.",neutral
I guess he is.,neutral
You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,neutral

I wanted to get this settled first.,neutral
"Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him.",neutral
And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.,neutral
Just give it some more thought.,neutral
What the hell is this?,anger
"I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.",neutral
You have a business here.  What the hell is this?,anger
Oh.  Must you be inspired?,anger
"On this, I would.",neutral
"All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.",anger
Just don't think like that.,anger
That's how you get the big bucks.  Are you messing with the chair? Don't ruin it.,happiness
Can I help you?,neutral
I need a little more information.,neutral
Georgia?,neutral
"There's no need for you to raise your voice, sir.",neutral

Yeah it's really unfortunate you know why because I'm going to get fired if I don't get that.  So I need to have that back.,anger
That's too bad.,neutral
"Fifty dollars is not going to cover me for my job, okay?",anger
Well you need to find it. Can I just go back there and look through the bags?  Can I just go back there and just go through maybe I'll find it.,anger
That's not - no.,neutral
No.,neutral
It'll be a lot more than what you're doing sitting here and just give me lip service.  I'd like to go back at least do some aggressive searching for my stuff.,anger
We have plenty of aggressive searching going on it's not there.  Someone's taken it.,neutral
"Sure, yeah right you have plenty of aggressive searching going on, aggressive searching, drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes.",anger
I know what you guys do when you're not working you're union people; you just sit around on your ass.,anger
Thank you very much.,anger

So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and--,neutral

"It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said ""let's get some champagne"" and I said ""no time to wasting"" or something like that.  That's what it is, right?",neutral
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,sadness
"Oh right sure, of course.",neutral
No.,sadness
No.,sadness
Do you want to take off our shoes?,neutral
"A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what?  What?  What the hell do you want?",anger
I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.,anger
You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No.,anger
"No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and--",sadness

That's my point too.,neutral
Then let's go.,anger
People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up.,anger
"Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die.",anger

Mmhmm.,neutral
"Some, I guess.  She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and-",sadness
"I remember, too, when we were--  she died at U.C.L.A.

It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden?,anger
"Well uh, He grew up next door to the girl, why wouldn't he want to see her?",neutral
"What is going on here, Joe?",anger
The girl is not Larry's.  If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not.,anger
"I want you to---act like he is coming back.  Don't think I haven't noticed you, both of you since Chris invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",anger

Don't raise your voice with me.,anger
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.,anger
Do you know how long I've been working here? How long have you lived in California?,anger

I am not...I'm not getting to back that line.,anger
Why?,anger
"Why, because I'm sick of talking to you.",anger
"'Cause you're obviously not talking to me, you're just yelling at me, berating me and telling me I can't fill out forms right.",anger
However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.,neutral
Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.,happiness

You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,neutral
I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,neutral
"Well, what of it?",neutral
What about me?,anger
Don't be stupid.,anger
"Really, Amanda.",anger
What?,anger
No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you.,anger
Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man.,anger
"Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true.",neutral
No it isn't.,anger
Yes it is.,neutral
You shut up.,anger
"Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable.",anger
"Snap, snap, snap.  You know you are like a little adder.",anger
Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap.,anger
They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops.,anger
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,anger
"Yes I did, quite a lot.",anger
"And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes.  I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh?  All out, no restraint at all.  Well, you never really had much anyhow.",anger
Mind your own business.,anger
"You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk.",anger
I think I am not in the least bit drunk.,anger
You've always had a weak head.,anger
I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that.,anger
"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",anger
"That's very interesting Amanda. How about a child of four?  Or a child of six?  Or a child of nine? We can get a good little conversation going on about this, you know, intemperate tots.",anger
Oh shut up.,anger
Shut up.,anger
"Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy.",anger
"Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs.",anger
Why?,neutral
There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.,neutral
Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs.,anger
This is no time of year for Tunis.,neutral
I will do no such thing.,anger
Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,anger
"Will you turn that off, it's driving me mad.",anger
"You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself.",anger
Turn it off.,anger
"I won't.  Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen?  I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",anger
"Amanda, listen, listen.",anger
Oh.  That's very amusing indeed.,anger
"Oh shut up.  Let go.  I hate you, I hate you.  Do you hear?  You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",anger
"You are a vile, ill-tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I never want to see you again as long as I live.",anger
This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever.,anger
You're not going like this.,anger
Oh.  Yes I am.,anger
You're not.,anger
"Yes I am.   Stop it. Stop it.  Let go of me. Oh.  You're a cruel fiend.  I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again?  Never, never, never. I hope you die in torment, you brute beast cad.",anger
"Shut up. Shut up. God, I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee.  You are a vile, ill-tempered, mean little wench and I never want to see you again as long as I live.",anger

"You're kidding me, this is a joke.",anger
Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars?  That's supposed to replace everything that I have?  Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that.  It was incredibly expensive.,anger
Yes.,neutral
We flew in from Paris.  I've been shopping for three weeks.,anger
I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience.,anger
Okay. Calm-,neutral

"Yeah, sure.",neutral
Well I lost them.,sadness
Pretty much all.,sadness
"Aw, geez.",sadness
You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?,sadness
"Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had.",sadness
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.",sadness
Mmhmm.,neutral
"To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.",sadness
"But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work.",sadness
And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.,sadness
I just want you to know Annie.,neutral
There's a lot of people looking for jobs.,neutral

How do you know he's even thinking about it?,neutral
It's got that about it.,anger
"What is going on here, Joe?",anger
She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.,anger
"Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.",anger
How do you know why she waited?,neutral
"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.",anger
"Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",anger
"I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here.",anger
I won't stand for any nonsense.,anger
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look.",anger
"Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe.",anger

I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.,anger
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,anger
You let him kiss you; you said you did.,anger
What of it?,neutral
"It gave him a lot of pleasure, it didn't hurt me any.",neutral
What about me?,anger
"No particular reason. Anyhow, they are very small ones.",neutral
It just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,neutral
What?,anger
No I'm just making myself fascinating for you.,neutral
"Going out somewhere, dear?",neutral
Be quiet.,anger
I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.,anger
"Tell me, did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?",neutral
What riotous time you must have had.,anger
"No restraint at all, very enjoyable, never had much anyhow.",anger
Oh be quiet.,anger
"We can get a good little debate going about that, don't you think? Intemperate tots.",anger
Better turn that off I think.,neutral
You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.,anger
Turn it off.,anger
Stop it. Stop it. I hate you.,anger
"Amanda, listen. Listen.",anger
"Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.",anger
Very amusing indeed.,anger
"Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.",anger
"You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope I never see you again as long as I live.",anger
"This is the end, do you hear? The end finally and forever.",anger
You're not going like this.,anger
Oh yes I am.,anger
You're not.,anger

Shut up.,anger
Shut up.,anger
I wouldn't marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees. You're a evil minded little vampire. I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.,anger
You're a beast. I hate you. Stop it. Stop it.,anger
I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen.,sadness
No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.,sadness

You know why I brought Annie here don't you?,neutral
You know.,neutral
I got an idea but what's the story?,neutral
See it isn't just my business-,anger
"I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time.",anger
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.,neutral
To hell with that.,anger
I wanted to get this settled first.,neutral
"I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me.",sadness
"Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.",anger
I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,anger
"If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out.",sadness
What the hell is this?,anger
"I'll get out. I'll get married and go live some place else, maybe New York.",sadness
"What the hell is this, are you crazy?",anger
"I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it.",anger
What about the business? What is this?,anger
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,anger
Must you be inspired?,anger
"Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.",anger
"Tell me, you'd leave the business?",anger
"Yes, on this I would.",sadness
"Well, you don't want to think like that.",anger
"Yea, I can see that.",sadness
What I was saying.,neutral
Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,neutral
Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.,anger
We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.,anger
I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.,anger
"I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is.",anger
Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.,sadness
"We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses, you asked me to dance, we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.",sadness
And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them,sadness
"and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be",sadness
"Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",sadness
I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.,sadness
No.,sadness
You want to go get some champagne?,neutral
No.,sadness
Take off our shoes?,neutral
"Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?",anger
"Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.",sadness
"No, I know. Me neither.",sadness
"I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",sadness
Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,sadness
"No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy.",sadness
Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that?,happiness
"You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.",sadness
I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here.,happiness
"Augie, I'm sorry.",sadness
Or not.,happiness
Or not.,happiness
I don't want you to go.,sadness
"I know, I know. I don't want to go either baby. I love you know. And I'm going to miss you a lot.",sadness
"I'm going to miss you too; I don't know what I'm going to do here without you. It's going to be so lonely, and so hard.",sadness
I don't want to be a single mom.,sadness
"You won't be. I'll be back; I'll be back before you know it. All right, and",sadness
but,sadness
and,sadness
It's dangerous; I mean how can you make sure that you'll,sadness
I hope so.,sadness
I hope so.,sadness
It's going to be really rough.,sadness
"You gotta take care of our baby for me, alright?",sadness
I'll send you lots of pictures.,sadness
"I hope so, because I'm not going to be able to survive without all that. I don't know what I'm going to do.",sadness
I've never been - I've never been away from you for two weeks let alone a year.,sadness
"Well, just promise me that you going to be safe.",sadness
"I mean can't they put you in like, you know kitchen work or something where you won't get",sadness
there's people that thought it was the right thing to do so now we have to- we have to do what we have to do for our country,sadness
"Will you write me letters, paper ones?",sadness
"Our baby needs a dad; you can't leave. Okay, you can't disappear.",sadness
"Our baby has a dad, alright. Daddy is going to be back soon.",sadness
"I want you to, you know, take lots of video; pictures and I can see you when I get back or while I'm there. I'm going to miss you.",sadness
I'll miss you too.,sadness
Good God.,fear
Must be them then.,fear
"We're all right darling, aren't we whatever happens?",fear
What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,fear
"Yes, I should probably to a court curtsey.",happiness
"Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's is happy, do they?",happiness
Oh darling don't say that.,sadness
"No, that desire will fade along with our passion.",sadness
"Oh dear, should we like that?",sadness
"Well, what happens if one of us dies, does the one that's left still laugh?",fear
Which particular one?,happiness
I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal; I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,happiness
It went on intermittently for days.,happiness
What flashlight?,neutral
"I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember?",neutral
Do you want my jacket?,neutral
Right.,neutral
"Well, so what do you think?",neutral
About what?,neutral
What I was saying.,neutral
"from her point of view, why else would I come?",sadness
I almost got married two years ago.,happiness
Every day since.,happiness
I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,happiness
No.  Nothing like that.,sadness
"Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.",sadness
"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",sadness
You've gotta tell me.,sadness
I don't know how to start.,sadness
It wouldn't work this way.,sadness
"It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?",sadness
"Yeah, sure.",sadness
"Well, I lost them.",sadness
How many?,sadness
Just about all.,sadness
"Oh, gee.",sadness
It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.,sadness
"For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.",sadness
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",sadness
"I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man.",sadness
"You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.",sadness
Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.,sadness
"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",sadness
"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.",sadness
Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.,sadness
You still feel that way?,sadness
"I know, it went out of style, didn't it?",happiness
It's all right.  It's a good thing.,happiness
"You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet.",happiness
What?,surprise
"I knew they would, your mother anyway.",happiness
"Well, from her point of view, why else would I come?",neutral
Why didn't you?,surprise
"Well, you started to write me",happiness
Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.,sadness
No.  Nothing like that.,sadness
"Well, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.",sadness
"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",sadness

"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",sadness
"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.",sadness
Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you.,sadness
Do you still feel that way?,sadness
"'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything you have, Chris.  Everything, you understand that?  Me too.",sadness

"Um, that you would need to go home and get another form of ID and come back.",neutral
"What? I- You telling me I waited in that huge line to go and sit down and get my number called, like after",anger
three hours and,anger
Shouldn't they have like told us about that? I mean why - why would they make me go and wait three hours if I have got to go and do it again?,anger

You- shouldn't you have like a sign or something maybe like up on the counter when you get the applica- maybe on the application,anger
"What web- I didn't go to a website - why would I need to - it's the D.M.V.. You come to the D.M.V., you wait in line for three hours, and then you go home.",anger
"Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is -",neutral

You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's,neutral
I'm sorry.,sadness
"I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking",sadness
So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.,neutral
this doesn't happen to a normal person.,anger
"You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering.",neutral
"But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop.",neutral
"Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop.",neutral
Right. Thanks for talking to me.,sadness
"So, uh, so how's it been going?  I mean, you have any needs or anything?",neutral
"No.  You can't think that way.  I mean it's good--it's good that you're--that you're calling, you know. you can't",neutral
"No.  It's--I mean, it's competitive, you know.  That's-That's what it is.  that's what you gotta be is competitive.",neutral
...dumber than you.  I mean they're a lot worse off than you.  You are much better off than like a lot of those people in there. I know,neutral
I feel so worthless.,sadness
"It's not worthless 'cause it's definitely gonna--it's definitely gonna pay off.  I know it.  I mean, I can--I've just--I've seen your work etiquette.  You know, you're a good worker and...",neutral
"Because I know you.  You know, and maybe once you get to know some more people, like talking to them and everything, they'll get to know you too and they'll realize they should've hired you three years ago.

How do you know he's even thinking of it?,neutral
It's got that all about it.,anger
"Well, so what?",neutral
"Now, listen Kate.",neutral
You can't read her mind.,neutral
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but...",anger
But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it.,anger
What does that mean?  Me above all?,anger
Look at you.  Look at you shaking.,anger
What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate?,anger
What I was saying.,neutral
It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,neutral
"God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.",anger
We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.,anger
"There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home.",neutral
We've missed them twice.  That's not ever.,neutral
"Well, we'll see them this year.",neutral
"I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.",anger
"Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--",neutral
"Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married.",sadness
"I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.",sadness
"And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.",sadness
"And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",sadness
Wait a minute.  I've got it.,neutral
"Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",sadness
I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.,sadness
"Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance?",neutral
No.,sadness
No.,sadness
No.,sadness
"Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?",anger
"No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us",sadness
Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,sadness
"I know, me neither.",sadness
I'm doing the best I can.,sadness
"I know that, Augie.  Really, I do.",sadness
"I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",sadness
Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,sadness
I didn't say that.,sadness
"No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.",sadness
Yeah?,surprise
You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.,sadness
"I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here.",happiness
"Well, then we don't need glasses.",happiness
"Augie, I'm sorry.",sadness
Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.,happiness
Or not.,happiness
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",neutral
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,neutral
What of it?,anger
"Well, what about me?",anger
"Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",neutral
"Me, too.  Bored stiff.  You want some brandy?",neutral
Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,neutral
"Well, it's become a habit with you.",neutral
"You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.",anger
Don't be so stupid.,anger
What?,anger
"Oh, be quiet.",anger
"Adders don't snap, they sting.",anger
You're quite insufferable,anger
I'm not in the least drunk.,anger
Shut up.,anger
"We could get a good debate going about this, don't you think?  Intemperate tots.",anger
Why?,anger
"Turn it on again, please.",anger
I'll do no such thing.,anger
"Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.",anger
Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,anger
You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,anger
Turn it off.,anger
Stop it.  Go away.  I hate you.,anger
"Amanda, listen. listen",anger
"Listen?  Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.",anger

"You're a vile, tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope to never see you again as long as I live.",anger
This is the end.  Finally and forever.  Do you hear me?  The end.,anger
You're not going like this.,anger
"Oh Yes, I am.",anger
You're not.,anger
I am.  Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you.,anger
Shut up. Shut up.,anger
I wouldn't-- I wouldn't marry--,anger
I wouldn't marry you if you came in crawling on your knees,anger
Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it.  Stop it.,anger
You're a evil vampire and I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.,anger
Did you talk to him?,sadness
He cried hard?,sadness
What was he doing out here at that hour?,sadness
Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now?,anger
"For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.",anger
"I've got an idea, but what's the story?",sadness
What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,anger
"Well, then it isn't just my business--",anger
She's not Larry's girl.,anger
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.,neutral
To hell with that.,anger

She's been in New York three and half years why all of a sudden-,anger
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,anger
He's not going to marry her.,anger
What's going on here Joe?,anger
-She's not his girl Joe; she knows she's not.,anger
"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since he invited her, I won't stand for any nonsense",anger
I need you to believe with me; I can't stand all alone.,sadness
"What does that mean, me above all?",anger
Look at you -- look at you shaking.,anger
Is that a demand sir?,neutral

Fine.  Call your supervisor.  Ask supervisor over,anger
No.  I'm not going anywhere.  I'm staying here-- I am filling out right now okay just calm down. I'm filling out right now-- Just take the god damn piece of paper.,anger
Okay.  I'm going to call security. Security!,anger

[BREATHING],neutral
"I mean, nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",fear
What are we to do?,fear
"Oh dear, well, shall we want that?",sadness
"Well, what if happens if one of us is to die? Does the one that's left still laugh?",sadness
Why did he invite her here?,anger
Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up.,anger
"Well maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.",neutral
"Well, so what?",neutral
No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.,anger
How do you know why she's waited?  Hmmm?,neutral
"I mean, her faith is stronger than a rock.",anger
"My worst times I think about her, you know, and I",sadness
it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again.,sadness
"No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother.",anger
"Laugh, laugh at me but I will.  Because you know what happened when she came here?  When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me.",anger
"Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe.",sadness
"Alright, alright, calm yourself okay?  Calm yourself. Wait, wait.  What do you mean, me above all?",anger
"Wait, what does that mean?  Me above all?",anger
"Look at you, you're shaking.",anger
I can't help it.,sadness
What do I got to hide?  Huh?  What the hell's the matter with you Kate?,anger
You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.,happiness
No. I'm not sorry. It's-,sadness
Well-,neutral
"Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.",sadness

Why didn't you?,surprise
You felt something that far back?,happiness
Every day since.,happiness
Why didn't you let me know?,happiness
"Give me a kiss, Annie.",happiness
I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.,happiness
I kissed you.,happiness
Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you.,sadness
No. What is it? Is it your mother?,sadness
"No, no, no, no. Nothing like that.",neutral
"Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed.",sadness
"Yeah. I guess there is. I guess I was, but uh- it's going from me now.",sadness
You should tell me.,sadness
I don't know where to start.,sadness
"But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this.",sadness
You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company.,sadness
"Yeah, sure.",sadness
"Well, I lost them.",sadness
How many?,sadness
Just about all.,sadness
Geez.,sadness
It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.,sadness
"For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket.",sadness
"I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.",sadness
"And I, and I thought something watching them go down.",sadness
"Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?",sadness
And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.,sadness
And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.,sadness
And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.,sadness
"And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.",sadness
"Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it.",sadness
And I didn't want to take any of it.,sadness
And I guess that included you.,sadness
And you still feel that way?,sadness
"Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.",sadness
"Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting.",anger
Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up.,anger
Do you remember the last time we came here?,sadness
We thought I was pregnant.,sadness
You brought a bottle of champagne.,sadness
We took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand. Under the moon.,happiness
"I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be.",sadness
Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne.,happiness
I don't want to remember something.,sadness
Hope for some things.,sadness
No.,sadness
No.,sadness
"No, no.",sadness
No.,anger
"A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla?",anger
"No, it's not. It's standing on the beach waiting and fighting.",anger
Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.,sadness
it's not something else. Do you know what I'm trying to say?,sadness
"I know you are, Augie, and I know you wanted this evening to be nice, but I can't help thinking of being somewhere else.",sadness
I didn't say that.,sadness
Yeah?,surprise
It's not champagne.,happiness
At least we won't need glasses.,happiness
Maybe this is the right place after all.,happiness

He was out there when it happened.,sadness
When?,surprise
About four in the morning.  I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened.,sadness
I don't know. But after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen.,sadness
Did you talk to him?,sadness
No.  I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone.,sadness
He cried hard?,sadness
I could hear it right through the floor.,sadness
I guess he is.,sadness
"He's getting just like he did after he died, you know?  What, what, what's the meaning of this?",sadness
"I don't know.  But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.",sadness
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.,anger
"Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?",anger
That we haven't had any hope for years now?,anger

But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.,sadness

I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,sadness
I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it.,anger
You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that.,anger
The business doesn't inspire me.,anger
Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.,anger
Tell me something.  You can leave this business?,sadness

What have I got to hide?,anger
"Huh? What the hell's the matter with you, Kate?",anger
"Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that.",neutral
Presents?  A trivial little broach.,anger
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,anger
You must admit he was in love with you.,anger
Just a little perhaps but nothing serious.,neutral
You let him kiss you. You said so.  What of it?,anger
"Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me.",neutral
And what about me?,anger
"Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say.",anger

You want some brandy?,neutral
I'll have a little I think.,neutral
I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.,anger
No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.,anger
I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.,anger
Oh my...just because I just...okay...,anger
You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.,anger
What?,anger
That's the woman's job to lure the man.  Watch me a moment won't you?,neutral
Actually that's perfectly true.,neutral
Yes it is.,neutral
"Adders don't snap, they sting.",anger
They sting.,anger
Mind your business.,anger
You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.,anger
I'm not in the least bit drunk.,anger
You've always had a weak head.,anger
"Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk.",anger
"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy.",anger
"Oh, what an interesting topic.  What about a child of four and a child of six?  A child of nine?",anger
Shut up.,anger
We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.,anger
"Not very funny dear.  In fact, maybe you better have some more brandy.",anger
"Oh, thanks.  I think I will.",anger
You better turn that off.,anger
No I'll do no such thing.,anger
Very well.  If you insist on being a boorish and idiotic.,anger
"Come on, turn it off.  It's driving me mad.",anger
You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,anger
Turn it--Turn it off.,anger
Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.,anger
Very amusing indeed.,anger
"I hate you.  Listen I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",anger
"You know what?  You're a vile, little, evil-minded, little, wicked beast and I never want to see you again.",anger
"This is the end.  Understand?  This is the end, here and now, forever and always.",anger
You're not going nowhere. No you're not.,anger
"Oh, yes I am. Yes I am and you can't stop me.",anger
Just shut up.,anger

All right  Uh-,neutral
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",anger
I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.,anger
I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste.,anger
You let him kiss you. You said so.,anger
What about me?,anger
"That's a nice point of view, I must say.",anger
"I'll have a little, I think.",neutral
It's become a habit with you.,neutral
You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment.,anger
Don't be so stupid.,anger
"Really, Amanda.",anger
What?,anger
Nothing.,anger
"Going somewhere, dear?",anger
"It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute?",neutral
"No, it isn't.",anger
"Yes, it is.",anger
They snap.,anger
"I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops.",anger
did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,anger
"I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you?",anger
You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.,anger
You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk.,anger
I'm not in the least bit drunk.,anger
"Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.",anger
"Well, I suppose the people downstairs then.",anger
Turn it on.,anger
Turn it off.,anger
I will not. Go away. Go away. I hate you.,anger
"Oh, very amusing, indeed. Amanda, listen-",anger

Very amusing indeed.,anger
"Stop it, stop it, I hate you, I loath you, you are overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.",anger
"You know, you're a vile, ill-tempered, wicked little beast and I hope that I never see you again as long as I live.",anger
This is the end. Do you hear? The end. Now and forever.,anger
"No, you're not going out like this. No you're not.",anger
"Oh, yes I am.",anger
"Yes I am. Let go of me. I hate you and I loath you. God, I can't believe I just finally realized how you are. I am never marry you. Never. Never, never, never. I would rather die in torment.",anger
"Oh, shut up. Shut up. Shut up.",anger
"I wouldn't marry you again if you came back crawling to me on your hands and knees because you're vile. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.",anger

Baltimore and this is a direct flight to LAX,neutral
Okay.  Let's look up here,neutral
Yes.,neutral
the luggage was left in Baltimore.  Therefore--,neutral
Most of the...,anger
"Like the luggage, the luggage on the flight.",neutral
I'm going to San Diego tomorrow to stay with my family.  What do I need hotel lodging for hmmm?  Can you tell me that?,anger
Wow.  Thank you.  Holiday Inn.  Wow.  Thank...the flight cost five hundred dollars.,anger
"Okay, so you can put me in Holiday Inn for twenty dollar a night?",anger
Of course I had my name tags on the luggage.,anger
Soon as you...that's not good enough okay?,anger
What is your business?,neutral
"Okay.  Sir?  I am sorry to tell you this but this does happen. Uh- This is not uh- really,",neutral
"I mean, our airline's fault.  I don't know what happened, misplaced, something happened but we will get you--",neutral
"You misplace a lot of, eight pieces of luggage.",anger
"Well, the entire flight, sir, the luggage was placed on another plane that never actually left Baltimore.",neutral
Uh no I'm not.,neutral
Are you kidding me?,anger
Who are you going to fire because of that?,anger
"Well we have some people back there that need some firing so, but I would just really appreciate--",neutral
"Wow.  This has never happened before.  I've not lost,",anger
in all thousand flights I've been on probably I can't even count how many flights I've been on.  This has never happened before.,anger
This is the worst customer service I've ever gotten before.,anger
Okay.  Get on the phone and figure out where my luggage is and tell me when it's going to get there alright?,anger
"And and, in about...",anger
Can you get it to the San Diego airport?  You get someone to drive it to my place alright? Then I get a refund for some...I get a free flight alright? I get free whatever.,anger
"Yes sir, Yes.",neutral
We can have them direct your luggage to San Diego.,neutral
Uh--,neutral
Some peanuts?  Wow.  That helps a lot.,anger
"Thanks you, thank you I don't have my luggage so you gave me a Holiday Inn stay and peanuts.  Wow.  You know what?",anger
I will never do business with Delta again.,anger
No.  I'm not sorry.  But I'm not going to stay.,sadness
Why?,surprise
"Look,",sadness
"you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of...",sadness
What?,neutral
"Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came.",sadness
I guess that's why I came.,happiness
"I was waiting for you Chris, I mean, till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say?",happiness
We're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.,happiness
"Nothing.  Hey, let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.",sadness
You remember overseas I was in command of a company?,sadness
Well I lost them.,sadness
How many?,sadness
Just about all.,sadness
Geez.,sadness
Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men.,sadness
"For instance, one time this...it had been raining several days and this one kid, he came up to me, he gave me his last pair of dry socks, put them in my pocket.",sadness
"That's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had.  They didn't just die, they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly.",sadness
A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.,sadness
"It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me?",sadness
And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.,sadness
And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.,sadness
"And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all.",sadness
"It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive.  I felt wrong to have that new checkbook,",sadness
"open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerator",sadness
"cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that.",sadness
Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.,sadness
And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.,sadness
And you still feel that way?,sadness
"that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.",sadness
Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.,happiness
What am I going to do with a fortune?,happiness

"Yeah, it really is.",happiness
Oh my God.  I am so proud of you.,neutral

It's going- It's going to be probably in about three weeks.,sadness
What? You can't do that. Three weeks?,surprise
yeah,sadness
"I can't- No, I can't do this alone.",anger
"Yeah, and uh--",sadness
"Honey, I'm going to come back. It's not like that.",sadness
But it- it is for a year.,sadness
"Babe, I'm sorry. But I don't want to do.",sadness
"You know as much as -as much as me that I-I want to stay here with you and Amy so bad, but I can't.",sadness
I have to work.,sadness
"Babe, I love you.",sadness
You can't leave your daughter alone like this.,sadness
"But she has you. I mean, that's what you're there for. You're my right-hand man.",sadness
It's going to be okay.,sadness
You can't postpone it?,sadness
"No, I have to go.",sadness
"Wait, you can write me and as you know, send me pictures.",sadness
I don't know if I can handle you going another year.,sadness
What do you mean?,sadness
I don't know if I- if I could take it.,sadness
"Look, I need you to be strong for me. 'Cause I can't be the only one that's strong right now, really, I--",sadness
I can't be that strong. A whole year.,sadness
"me, oh my god.",sadness
"and if we survive, if we survive that then babe, you know you know we could survive any--",sadness
I will come back.,sadness
It doesn't look very good.,sadness
we'll have all the money that we ever needed.,sadness
And- And then I'll stop working and- I'll stay home with the baby.,sadness
I don't want the money. I want-you here,sadness
If your life is going to be in danger and this family is going to be in danger we don't need the job. We'll find the money.,anger
It's all I ever knew how to do. I can't quit now.,sadness
How are we supposed to tell Amy? How's she supposed to understand that?,sadness
"Well, we- we tell her mommy's going on va- on a trip for for- a while.",sadness
"How is she going to feel the first year in school, no mom.",sadness
Don't do that to me.,sadness
"It's hard enough already, Brian, I can't.",sadness
I know.,sadness
"I didn't expect this to happen. I never planned for this. Some things you just don't plan for, you know.",sadness
"I'm sorry, babe.",sadness
I'm so sorry.,sadness
"All right, then.",sadness
He saw it.,neutral
He was out there when it happened.,neutral
"Um, about four this morning. Uh- I heard a crack and I looked out and I saw him standing there.",neutral
I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen.,neutral
Did you talk to him?,neutral
"No, I uh-, I figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone.",neutral
I could hear it right through the floor.,neutral
"Could he-he's acting just like he did after he died, you know?",neutral
"It's those Goddamn newspapers, you know? I mean, it's like every day they come out with this new person that comes along. And the next one's going to be Larry.",anger
You know.,neutral
I want to ask her to marry me.,neutral
So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it.,neutral
"See, then it's not just my business. God, you have",anger
"-Oh, you infuriate me sometimes. You know, it's not just my business too if dad throws a fit.",anger
"Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time.",sadness
You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.,neutral
To hell with that.,anger
I wanted to get this settled first.,neutral
Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.,neutral
It just is. I-,neutral
Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.,anger
"Now, Annie's in the middle of all that.",anger
Tell me something.,neutral
You'd leave that business.,neutral
Okay. Just-,neutral

It just feels like I was talking to him yesterday.,sadness

You guys were real close huh?,sadness
He was my only friend growing up.,sadness
no one else would talk to me but he would.,sadness
He was supposed to be the best man at my wedding.,sadness
I'm so sorry.,sadness
Yeah.,sadness
You know I was always the one to tell him to be more wild you know?,sadness
And he just took it overboard.,sadness
What happened?  What went wrong?,sadness
You know a stupid case of drunk driving it's just...,sadness
"and the worst part of it is that he was in the car with his girlfriend,",sadness
his girlfriend got killed too.,sadness
Oh man.,sadness
And the car that he hit was his family.,sadness
How are they?,sadness
The mother and father died--,sadness
and the kids are paralyzed in a coma right now.,sadness

"-do I miss him or do I hate him, you know?",sadness
Yeah.  Like I mean if you need anyone to talk to or anything I'm here for you okay?,sadness

then I got busy with work and stuff and three years go by,sadness
and then something like this happens you know?,sadness
I mean I haven't even talked to him on the phone for the past three months.,sadness
He's supposed to be my best friend.,sadness
I know.,sadness
just things happen in life and you just...there's just no explanation you know?  We just don't...,sadness
It's so fucked up.,sadness
Yeah.,sadness
I'm so sorry.,sadness
Why is that?,sadness
He was studying to be a doctor.,sadness
"I mean he was...he wanted to help people in poor countries, that is his goal.  He didn't care about the money.  He just wanted to go and help people.",sadness
What the...what am I doing?,sadness
Working for corporate America?  Wow.,sadness
He actually wanted to do something.,sadness
"Well now you can follow his footsteps, you know?  Carry out what he wanted to do.",sadness
I can't do that.,sadness
Well sure you could.,sadness
You should've met him.,sadness
He is the greatest...everyone liked him.,sadness
Yeah.,sadness
I would've loved to.,sadness
Now I can't.,sadness
About what?,anger
It's ridiculous.,anger
"It's PR.  I mean, somebody sold you a good bill about this wonderful event that going to happen on the beach.",anger
"Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now.",anger
"Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.",anger
Okay.  Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever.,anger
"Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.",anger
"Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up.",anger
"Well, we're going to see it.",neutral
"No we won't.  I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie.",anger
We thought I was pregnant.,sadness
And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that.,neutral
You want this to be like the other time right?  That's it right?,neutral
I'd rather not remember something...,sadness
Rather not hope for something.,sadness
No.,sadness
I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.,anger
Welcome to the human race.,anger
Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No.,anger
I was just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids...,anger
...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this.,anger
Yes it is.,anger
Right.,anger
Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be.,anger
This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?,sadness
I know you are Augie.  I know you wanted this evening to be nice.,sadness
I can't help thinking about being somewhere else.,sadness
Maybe if you were with someone else too.,sadness
I didn't say that.,sadness
I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.,sadness
"Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you.",sadness
If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you.  Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard.,sadness
"Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people.",sadness
Yeah.  I noticed that.  It's real pretty on the water.,happiness
"Hey, look what we got here.",happiness
Oh you brought refreshments.,happiness

A whole year? --We're not talking about like a couple months here.  I mean this is a whole year.,sadness
I know.  I know.  But they really need some good guys there.,sadness
What could happen in a year?,sadness
And this isn't the first time you know?  I mean you always...sending you off to different places and...,sadness
Well that's the kind of work I'm in honey.,sadness
I don't know if that's how I want to live my life.,sadness
It's just going to be--it's going to go faster than you think.,sadness
"Joe I'm serious I don't want to have to have a little girl to tell...asking every day where's daddy, where's daddy and have to tell her that he's away--",sadness
far away and he won't be here.,sadness
You tell her-- [BREATHING],sadness

"What, no way.",surprise
Really?,surprise
"Yeah.  I like to know about history, 'cause, you know, it's- it's just so relevant to the present.",happiness

What?,surprise
You can't say that to him.,anger
We've gotta say it to him.,anger
How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?,anger
"For God's sake, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.",anger
"To you it is and to me, but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body and no grave, so where are you?",anger
What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,anger
Well you want to make sure your father isn't going to have --,neutral
"Well, then you know it's not only my business.",anger
"Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.",anger
I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.,anger
"From father's point of view, he's not dead.  And you have no right to take his girl.",anger
I wanted to get this settled first.,neutral
I don't see why it has to be Annie.,anger
Yes we did. Do you want to keep going?,neutral

What the hell is this?,anger
Are you crazy?,anger
You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?,anger
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,anger
Must you be inspired?,anger
"Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful.",anger
"Yes, on this I would.",neutral
You don't want to think like that.,anger
"Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you.",anger

Hello.  Thank you for calling Dell Taco Corporate.  Can I help you?,happiness

"and if I get sent to another operator, I'll have to tell them the same damn story again.  I don't- I think I'm just going to lose my mind.  So if you could please just not do that, that would be great.  Thank you.",anger
You don't understand because you've never gone to Del Taco and gotten the service that I've gotten.  You don't understand.,anger
You're not going to call the other operator. You're not going to call the the other operator.,anger
You're going to fill out a form on your desk,anger
because I know you're at a desk right now in your stupid corporate building and you're going to send me a check for sixteen dollars and forty two cents.,anger
Cindy?  Cindy what?,anger
"Cindy, look.  If you don't get your ass a piece of paper that has a check",anger

But I'm giving you what you want.,anger
Well so what'd you think?,neutral

Well what's bugging you?,anger
We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.,anger

"We never do, do we?  Have we ever?",anger
"I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.",anger
"It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.",sadness
Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.,sadness

Mind your own business.,anger
You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.,anger
I'm not in the least drunk.,anger
You always had a weak head.,anger
"On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",anger
"Oh, shut up.",anger
"Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.",anger
Very good idea.  I will.,anger
Why?,anger
There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.,anger
There are people downstairs I suppose.,anger
This is no time of year for Tunis.,anger
Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,anger
Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,anger
You're far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,anger

Stop.,anger

Shut up.  Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees.,anger
"You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore.",anger
I'd rather die in torment. Beast.  Brute.  Calf swine.,anger

You won't even know your child when you come back.  This -- isn't there someone you could talk to?,sadness
When do you leave?,sadness
A week.  You're giving me a week to be okay with this.,anger

There's so many things mixed up.,sadness
You remember overseas I was in command of a company?,sadness

I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had.,sadness
They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.,sadness
"And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made",sadness
a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me?,sadness
And then I came home and it was amazing.,sadness
"I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow",sadness
because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.,sadness
"I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator.",sadness
"when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that.",sadness

"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.",anger
"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",anger
"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",anger
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.",anger
Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here?,anger
She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--,anger

"Yeah, well that's got everything I have in it.",anger
Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.

Thank you for being here.,sadness
You know I think- I think we should celebrate because I think that's what he would have wanted.,sadness

How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?,anger
For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.,anger
To you it is and to me but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you?,anger

You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't?,anger

"I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm?",anger
Mind your own business.,anger
You must have had a riotous time.,anger
"No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.",anger
You're quite insufferable.  I expected it's because you're drunk.,anger
I'm not in the least drunk.,anger
You always had a weak head.,anger
"On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",anger
Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine?,anger
"Oh, shut up.",anger
"Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.",anger
Very good idea.  I will,anger
You better turn that off I think.,anger
Why?,anger
There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.,anger
"There are people downstairs, I suppose",anger

It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,anger
Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.,anger
We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.,anger

Well you have to have faith because I don't have a choice and I have to go.,sadness
Do you think I want to leave you?,sadness
I have to do this.  I don't want to leave.  Do you think I want to miss seeing her grow up?,sadness

That's how you want to leave it?,anger
"I don't know how else to leave it.  What, do you want me to lie to you?",sadness
You want me tell you that I'm okay with it?,sadness
I want you to be okay with it as much as you can be.  I mean it's not a great situation but we don't have an option here.,sadness

a major part of your life and then they're gone.  And I don't know.  That's not really -- it's never really happened to me before.,sadness
I'm sorry.  It's never easy.,sadness

"Yeah, I don't know.  Sometimes I wish I didn't know him.  So I wouldn't--",sadness
You feel that way now because you're upset.  But you don't really think that.,sadness
"It'll get better.  I know it doesn't help, but it will get better and you will remember all of the good things that you guys had; all of the memories that you have with him that were happy and you'll be grateful for those.",sadness
This is just -- this is a terrible life.  I just don't understand.,sadness
"I mean, it's just not fair.  Like, I don't know.  Why people -",sadness
"there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected.",sadness
"I agree.  If I knew how to make that happen, I would certainly help you.",sadness
I don't know what to do.,sadness
"When's the service? Can- can we help?  Is there anything, I mean--",sadness
"I mean, you- you can go.  I don't know.  I don't know what else.",sadness
I hope it rains.  Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable.,sadness
"Seems like if the whole world's sad, then it's okay for you to be.",sadness
Yeah.,sadness
I just wish there was some way to just bring him back to life magically.,sadness
I know.,sadness
"Just, you know, some thing; some genie. I need to find a genie bottle.",sadness

I'll have a little I think.,neutral
I don't see why you want any.  You've already had three glasses.,neutral

But if that can't happen then I'll just get out.,anger
What the hell is this?,surprise

Are you crazy?,anger
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,anger

Oh gee.,sadness
Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-,sadness
"for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.",sadness
"I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.",sadness
I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.,sadness
"And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-",sadness
"but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?",sadness
And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.,sadness
And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.,sadness
"It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.",sadness
And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and,sadness
"It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!",sadness
"Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.",sadness

I know.,sadness
I don't want to -- the kids.  You've got to take care of them.  You've got- you've got to-,sadness
"tell them about me and show them pictures of me and everything like that, because they are not going to see me for such a long time.  And it's such an important time and I just don't want to miss it.",sadness
I don't have -- I know.  What are we gonna- What are we- just run away?  What can I do?  Where can we go?,sadness
What would be the worst that would happen if they found you somewhere else?,neutral
"Well, they're so young.",sadness

But so many people have died.,fear
"I know.  I know.  I know.  But, you know what?  That doesn't mean it's gonna be me; does it?",sadness
No.  It doesn't.  And you can't think like that.,sadness
"I mean, I-I know that you're a good soldier, but not everybody else is. and what if",fear
I don't want you to -- I know.  I know. You can't worry about me.  You've got to worry about the kids.  And you've got to take care of the kids for me.  Okay?  Take care of the kids for me; all right?,sadness
It's just so much.,sadness
"I'll miss you, baby.",sadness
[GARBAGE] You have to write me everyday.,sadness

"Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.
