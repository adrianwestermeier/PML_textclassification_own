Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine .",anger

22240,No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.,excited
22241,They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.,excited
22242,It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.,excited
22243,They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place,excited

22263,How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?,anger
22264,For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.,anger

22266,Sit down mom.  I want to talk to you.,frustration

22278,Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things.,anger
22279,I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.,anger

22287,How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.,frustration

22290,The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,frustration
22291,So what I'm not fast with women.,anger
22292,I don't see why it has to be Annie.,anger
22293,Because it is.,anger
22294,Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.,anger

22296,"I don't want a diagram.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.",frustration
22297,You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't?,anger

24291,"Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?",neutral
24292,"Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.",anger
24293,That's what the cost of the ticket was for.,frustration
24294,"Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-",frustration
24295,"Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.",anger
24296,"Right. Yes, ma'am.",frustration
24297,And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.,anger
24298,"Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.",frustration
24299,"That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.",anger
24300,"Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?",neutral
24301,"Well, my hands are really tied then.",neutral
24302,Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?,frustration
24303,"Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--",neutral
24304,"Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.",frustration
24305,"Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?",neutral
24306,Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.,frustration
24307,"Uh, so it was really heavy.",neutral
24308,"Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.",frustration
24309,There's nothing else you can do?,frustration
24310,"I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.",neutral
24311,I don't believe that for a second.,anger
24312,Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.,neutral
24313,"Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.",frustration

24315,What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?,anger
24316,makes up?,neutral
24317,You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-,anger
24318,"The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.",neutral
24319,"So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?",frustration
24320,"Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.",frustration
24321,And you have no guarantee.,frustration
24322,"I have no guarantee, absolutely not.",frustration
24323,This is ridiculous.,frustration
24324,How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?,frustration
24325,"Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.",frustration
24326,"Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?",frustration
24327,"Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.",frustration
24328,"Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous",frustration
24329,"No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.",anger
24330,Right.,neutral
24331,It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.,anger
24332,"I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.",frustration
24333,"And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.",neutral
24334,So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?,neutral
24335,"Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.",frustration
