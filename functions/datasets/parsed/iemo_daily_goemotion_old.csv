Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine .",anger

18419,I could hear him right through the floor in my room.,sadness
18420,You know that Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,frustration
18421,"What do you want to do, argue with him?",frustration
18422,"No I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive anymore.",frustration
18423,"Why -- why shouldn't he dream of him? Walk around, waiting for him at night I mean do we contradict him, do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore that we haven't had hope for years now?",frustration
18424,You can't say that to him.,frustration
18425,We've got to say it to him.,anger

18440,She's not Larry's girl.,frustration
18442,"You can go on from there if you know where to go but I don't know where to go, see I don't know. So what can I do for you?",frustration
18443,"I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time.",anger

18452,So what I'm not fast with women.,frustration
18453,I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,anger
18454,Because it is.,frustration
18455,That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything. I mean you haven't seen her since you went away to war it's five years.,frustration

18465,The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,anger
18466,Must you be inspired?,anger
18467,"Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.",anger

18489,We've missed them twice; that's not ever.,frustration
18490,"Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever.",frustration
18492,"No we won't; it's pointless. It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus,",frustration
18493,I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.,anger
18494,I thought you wanted to see them.,frustration
18495,You don't understand anything I'm saying.,frustration
18496,No of course not.,frustration

18505,And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them,sadness
18506,"and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be",sadness
18507,"Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",sadness
18508,"It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right?",excited
18509,"Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?",excited

18523,I want something to turn out the way that it supposed to.,frustration
18524,"Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?",anger
18525,"No, no, just like you I thought it was going to be all like peaches and roses and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three, fat, rosy kids and ha-ha baby the joke is on us",frustration
18526,"'cause you know what you get Carla, you know what you get? This.",frustration
18527,"This? What, what is this? This isn't even anything.",frustration
18528,"I'm sure, this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, this is fighting.",frustration
18529,"Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.",sadness
18530,"No, I know. Me neither.",sadness
18531,I mean it's -- this is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but isn't something else. Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?,frustration

18628,"Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean,",excited
18629,this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.,excited
18630,"What are you so excited about?  I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.",frustration
18631,Yeah they do.,frustration
18632,"Ah, Augie.",frustration
18633,Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.,excited
18634,I'm just not.,frustration

18658,You've gotta tell me.,sadness
18659,I don't know how to start.,sadness
18660,It wouldn't work this way.,sadness

18664,How many?,sadness
18665,Just about all.,sadness

18672,Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.,sadness
18673,"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",sadness
18674,"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.",sadness
18675,Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.,sadness

My bag is worth more than that.,anger

22085,No.  No.  I don't know. You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer. You know what?  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option.,anger

22292,I don't see why it has to be Annie.,anger
22293,Because it is.,anger
